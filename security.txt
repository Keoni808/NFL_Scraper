Prompt: 

"Is there something I can use within my web scraper to ensure that it does not get banned from a website?"

Response:

Measures to make it hard to be banned:
1. User-Agent String
    - Use a legitimate user-agent string in your webscraper to identify it as a bot.
        - You can rotate between different user-agent string to mimic different browsers.

2. Request Throttling
    - Implement delays between your requests to avoid hammering the server with too many
      requests in a short period.
        - This can be done using 'time.sleep()'

3. Use Proxies
    - Rotating through different IP addresses using proxies can help avoid triggering IP-based
      rate limiting or bans.
        - Be sure that the use of proxies is compliant with the website's policies and legal
          in your jurisdiction.

4, Headless browsers
    - Selenium typically uses a headless browser, be aware that some sites might have measures to
      detect these browsers and may block them.
        - Configuring Selenium to mimic a non-headless browser can sometimes be beneficial.

5. Session Management
    - Maintain and manage sessions and cookies properly if the site requires login, as doing so
      can help in mimicking a real user's behavior more closely.

6. Error Handling
    - Implement robust error handling to gracefully manage HTTP error codes or exceptions without
      repeatedly hitting the server after an error.

7. Contact website
    - If your scraping activities are extensive, it might be worth contacting the website to inform
      them of your activities or request permission.
        - Some websites might provide an API for the data you need, which would be more reliable and
          respectful of the website's resources.
