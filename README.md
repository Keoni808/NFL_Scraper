# NFL_Scraper
**NFL_Scraper** is a web scraping tool designed to extract publicly available data from NFL.com. This tool enables users to efficiently gather information about NFL games, including scores and play-by-play breakdowns. Notably, it highlights the web elements from which data is being scraped, providing visual feedback during operation.

## Technology Stack
This scraper is built using Python and Selenium, specifically tailored for Google Chrome with ChromeDriver. Ensure that you have the latest version of Chrome and ChromeDriver installed to avoid any compatibility issues.

## Project Goal

The primary aim of this project is to provide users with the tools needed to access and collect NFL data. The extracted data includes:

- **Game Scores:** Retrieve final scores from any NFL game.
- **Game Details:** Collect play-by-play descriptions of game events.

## Project Status

**Development Stage:** This project is currently in its initial development phase. Functionality such as retrieving game scores is operational, but additional features and optimizations are planned. Future updates will focus on improving data extraction techniques and expanding the types of data available.

**2024 Season Compatibility:** Currently, NFL_Scraper does not support scraping data for the 2024 NFL season. Work is underway to address this issue, and updates will be provided as progress is made.

## Use Cases

The data collected with NFL_Scraper can be utilized in various applications, most notably in the development of machine learning models. The potential to analyze and model this data opens up exciting possibilities for predictions, sports analytics, and more.

## Data Cleaning

A significant aspect of this project that excites me is the data cleaning process. Preparing raw data for analysis is crucial, and NFL_Scraper aims to streamline this step to enable more effective data utilization in machine learning workflows.
